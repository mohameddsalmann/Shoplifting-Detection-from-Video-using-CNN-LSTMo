# Shoplifting-Detection-from-Video-using-CNN-LSTMo
This project is a deep learning pipeline for detecting shoplifting behavior from surveillance videos. It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for frame-level feature extraction with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM layers for temporal sequence modeling.
